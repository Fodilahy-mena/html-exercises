          </p>
          <p>
            It is typically used to group a set of h1–h6 elements to mark up a page's title with its subtitle or tagline.
             header elements may, however, contain more than just the section's headings and subheadings — e.g.,
              version history information or publication date..
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            It is used to represent a nested browsing context.
            For iframe elements in HTML documents, the attribute, if present,
             must have a value using the HTML syntax that consists of the following syntactic components,
              in the given order:
            Any number of comments and space characters.
            Optionally, a DOCTYPE.
            Any number of comments and space characters.
            The root element, in the form of an html element.

          <p>
            It allows a user to click on the link text it provides, and navigates to that link's location.

            The img element (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            It allows a user to put an image. The image given by the src attribute is the embedded content,
             and the value of the alt attribute is the img element's fallback content.
            The src attribute must be present, and must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially
             surrounded by spaces referencing a non-interactive, optionally animated,
              image resource that is neither paged nor scripted.
          </p>

            The list element (<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            It allows a user to make a list on a document.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The link element (<code>&lt;link&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            It allows  authors to link their document to other resources and it also allows
            reviewer to gain more informatio by clicking the link.
            The destination of the link(s) is given by the href attribute,
             which must be present and must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <p>
            The main element (<code>&lt;main&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main element is an exact analogue of ARIA's role="main",
             and is designed to show screenreaders and assistive technologies exactly where main content begins,
              so it can be a target for a "skip links" keyboard command, for example.
            It could also be used for content syndication (Instapaper-ish things);
                mobile browsers could zoom in on main when encountering non-responsive websites.
            It should therefore be used once per page.
            If you use something like <div id="main"> (or similar, such as <div id="content">),
                     simply replace that with <main role="main">.
          </p>

          <p>
            The meta element (<code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            The meta element represents various kinds of metadata that cannot be expressed using the title,
             base, link, style, and script elements.
            The meta element can represent document-level metadata with the name attribute,
              pragma directives with the http-equiv attribute,
               and the file's character encoding declaration when an HTML document is serialized to string form
                (e.g. for transmission over the network or for disk storage) with the charset attribute.

            The nav element (<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is used to represent navigation for a document.
            The nav element is a section containing links to other documents or to parts within the current document.
            Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element — only groups of primary navigation links.
            In particular, it is common for footers to have a list of links to various key parts of a site,
             but the footer element is more appropriate in such cases.

            The ordered list element (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            It allows a user to make a list of items, where the items have been intentionally ordered,
             such that changing the order would change the meaning of the list.
          </p>

            The option element (<code>&lt;option&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            It  represents an option in a select element or as part of a list of suggestions in a datalist element.
            In certain circumstances described in the definition of the select element,
             an option element can be a select element's placeholder label option. A placeholder label option does not represent an actual option,
              but instead represents a label for the select control.

          <p>
            It allows authors to include dynamic script and data blocks in their documents.

          </p>
          <p>
            Represents a generic document or application section. In this context, a section is a thematic grouping of content,
             typically with a header, possibly with a footer. Examples include chapters in a book,
              the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis.
            A web site's home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, contact information.
