        </p>
        <p>
          It allows a user to put an image. The image given by the src attribute is the embedded content,
          and the value of the alt attribute is the img element's fallback content.
          The src attribute must be present, and must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially
          surrounded by spaces referencing a non-interactive, optionally animated,
          image resource that is neither paged nor scripted.

        </p>
        <p>
          It allows authors to link their document to other resources and it also allows
          reviewer to gain more informatio by clicking the link.
          The destination of the link(s) is given by the href attribute,

          The main element (<code>&lt;main&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main element is an exact analogue of ARIA's role="main",
          and is designed to show screenreaders and assistive technologies exactly where main content begins,
          so it can be a target for a "skip links" keyboard command, for example.
          It could also be used for content syndication (Instapaper-ish things);
          mobile browsers could zoom in on main when encountering non-responsive websites.
          It should therefore be used once per page.

        <p>
          The meta element represents various kinds of metadata that cannot be expressed using the title,
          base, link, style, and script elements.
          The meta element can represent document-level metadata with the name attribute,
          pragma directives with the http-equiv attribute,
          and the file's character encoding declaration when an HTML document is serialized to string form
          (e.g. for transmission over the network or for disk storage) with the charset attribute.

        </p>
        <p>
          It is used to represent navigation for a document.
          The nav element is a section containing links to other documents or to parts within the current document.
          Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element — only groups of primary navigation links.
          In particular, it is common for footers to have a list of links to various key parts of a site,
          but the footer element is more appropriate in such cases.

        <p>
          It represents an option in a select element or as part of a list of suggestions in a datalist element.
          In certain circumstances described in the definition of the select element,
          an option element can be a select element's placeholder label option. A placeholder label option does not
          represent an actual option,
          but instead represents a label for the select control.

          Represents a generic document or application section. In this context, a section is a thematic grouping of
          content,
          typically with a header, possibly with a footer. Examples include chapters in a book,
          the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis.
          A web site's home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, contact information.

        <p>
          Represents side comments such as small print. It is not intended to be presentational.
          The small element should not be used for extended spans of text such as multiple paragraphs,
          lists, or sections of text. It is only intended for short runs of text.

          The source element allows authors to specify multiple alternative media resources for media elements.
          It does not represent anything on its own. The src attribute gives the address of the media resource.
          The value must be a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces. This attribute must be present.

          The document's title is often different from its first heading,
          since the first heading does not have to stand alone when taken out of context.
